🏦 ATM Abstraction Example in Python
This project demonstrates the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept of Abstraction using an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation.

It uses Python's built-in abc module to define an abstract class and methods, and then implements those methods in a concrete class.

📌 Concepts Covered
Abstraction using ABC and @abstractmethod

Abstract vs Concrete Classes

OOP principles in Python

Basic ATM operations: check_balance, deposit, withdraw

📁 File Structure
atm_example.py     # Main Python script containing the ATM logic
README.md          # Project explanation
🧾 Features
Abstract class ATM defines the required operations for any ATM system.

Concrete class BankATM implements those operations.

Includes balance check, deposit, and withdrawal with basic validation.

Demonstrates good practices of encapsulation and method overriding.

🚀 How to Run
Clone or download the repository.

Open the folder in VS Code.
